        <p>Drought has affected many countries in the past, only becoming more frequent with the rise of climate change. One such country which had faced a drought disaster was Singapore. The solution in which came up with was the “Four National Taps” plan. “For 40 years, Singapore’s “Four National Taps” water strategy has allowed the city-state to build a robust, diversified, and sustainable water supply.”(CDP, 2018) The plan involved providing multiple sources of water, through recycled water, desalinated seawater, local catchments and imported water. By having access to multiple sources of water, they were able to become water secure despite the droughts which have become more frequent with climate change. “Recycled and desalinated water now meet up to 65 percent of the city’s water demand…” (CDP, 2018). The use of a desalination plants could be greatly beneficial to Ethiopia, allowing farmers to have access to a steady supply of water in which they can not only use to irrigate their crops but also to drink from. Many citizens in Ethiopia lack even a safe water supply, meaning that adding another water supply is essential for the survival of the country.</p>
        <p>The Tampa Bay Water Desalination Plant is one of the largest in the USA. The plant uses a process known as reverse osmosis, in the water is blasted with high pressures into membranes, filtering out the salt minerals in the water. The plant can easily separate the water from salt water which is discharged back into the ocean and clean water which can be transported around the country for use. The water of course could also be tied in with electric generation, possibly used to cool generators or power turbines.</p>
        <p>Members of Cape town have already begun looking at possibilities of desalinating water in order to fight the drought they are having. They also aim to reduce the drought impacts by using renewable energy. If they were to use hydroelectricity, these two plants could together and create a better future for the country.</p>
