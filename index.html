      <h1 id="Head1">What is Food Security?</h1>
      <div id="Info1">
        <p>Food insecurity can occur when a country does not have the ability to produce the food required. This can be because of environmental conditions such as natural disasters, drought or global warming. It could also be that a disease spreads across the food, causing it to be unsafe for consumption. Food insecurity doesn’t have to be due to the environment, it can occur due to problems within the country. Poverty, war and political instability can all play a part in food insecurity.</p>
        <p>Some of the most food insecure countries include, Ethiopia, Timor-Leste and Palestine. Ethiopia suffers from a severe drought triggered by a large-scale weather event, “El Niño”, causing winds to move from east to west in the Pacific Ocean. The drought effectively left 8.5 million people in urgent need of food support and creating a huge impact in the agricultural business in the country. </p>
        <p>Timor-Leste, a South-Asian island nation situated between Indonesia and Australia, became independent in 2002. It is one of the newest countries in the world, successfully transitioning out of a period of conflict and is now under a stable democracy. The country however faces huge food security issues. Being vulnerable to weather-related disasters such as droughts, floods and landslides, the production of food in the nation is at risk. “As the effects of climate change intensify, production of the country’s two main food crops, maize and rice, will be increasingly threatened.” (World Vision, 2013) This has caused many children to become stunted due to malnourishment. 53% of the boys and 47% of the girls in the nation are stunted, creating major issues for their later lives and affecting the economy within the country as well.</p>
        <p>Hurricanes have left Haiti devasted, destroying large parts of the community. In 2016, on the 4th of October, Hurricane Matthew ripped through the country, affecting 2.1 million people in the nation. Vast amounts of crop land and fruit trees were destroyed, leaving the already drought affected country in an even more dire situation. There were already high-levels of malnutrition, making the disaster an even greater concern. More recently in 2017, Haiti had yet another hurricane disaster. “In the Caribbean, two extremely powerful hurricanes (Category 5 hurricanes Irma and Maria) in September devastated entire communities and exacerbated the already fragile food security situation in Haiti, where chronic poverty and successive climate disasters have undermined households’ resilience to shocks.” (FSIN, Page 3, 2018)</p>
